## hi there :)

I'm Jere, a graduate with a **B.S. in Computer Engineering (2025)** from Adamson University. 

My professional background includes internships focused on enterprise solutions. As a **Software Developer Intern** at *[Aboitiz Foods Group](https://aboitizfoods.com/)*, I developed a customer-facing web application using the jQuery framework and Google App Script to streamline payment processing. I established a data pipeline with Google Sheets and automated Google Drive integration for secure multi-file uploads. I also contributed to logistics optimization as a **Digital Transformation Intern** at *[Schneider Electric Philippines](https://www.se.com/ph/en/)*, where I developed the UI for a 3D truck container filler using Unity and C#.


Beyond my technical skills, I have proven leadership experience. I served as the **Chairperson for Sports and Recreation** in *[Adamson University Student Government](https://www.facebook.com/AdUStudentGovt)*, demonstrated leadership by running only 5 members to organize and execute the annual Sportsfest with over 400 student athletes from 8 colleges participating in 8 competitive sports, which earned me the **Rank 9 St. Vincent de Paul Leadership Award**. I also served as the **Executive President** of the *[Adamson Computer Engineering Society](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialACOES)*, directing a leading student organization and elevating its standing to be recognized as the Top 6 Student Organization campus-wide.
