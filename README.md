# hi :)

I'm Jere, a graduate with a <b>B.S. in Computer Engineering (2025)</b> from Adamson University. 

My professional background includes internships focused on enterprise solutions. As a <b>Software Developer Intern</b> at <i>Aboitiz Foods Group</i>, I developed a customer-facing web application using the jQuery framework and Google App Script to streamline payment processing. I established a data pipeline with Google Sheets and automated Google Drive integration. I also contributed to logistics optimization as a <b>Digital Transformation Intern</b> at <i>Schneider Electric Philippines</i>, where I developed a 3D truck container filler UI using Unity and C#.


Beyond my technical skills, I have proven leadership experience. I served as the Executive President of the Adamson Computer Engineering Society, leading the organization to be recognized as a Top 6 Student Organization campus-wide. I also managed complex logistics as the Chairperson for Sports and Recreation in the Student Government, organizing over 400 student athletes for the annual Sportsfest. This sustained leadership earned me the Rank 9 St. Vincent de Paul Leadership Award.
